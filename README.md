# DS_bootcamp_project
Final project to complete the data science bootcamp organized by Sages.

The aim of the project was to build a model predicting wine rating based on its description.

Highlights of the project:
* NLP analysis
* LDA topic modelling
* comparing three approaches to predictive modelling: 
                                                     - Nominal Classification
                                                     - Ordinal Classification
                                                     - Regression
                                                     
* Implementing NNRank - neural net for ordinal classification
* Implementing custom keras metric to calculate ordinal accuracy
* Trying out mord package for ordinal logistic regression                                                    
* Comparing LSTM NN with XGBClassifier/ XGBRegressor and Logistic Regression/ Linear Regression
