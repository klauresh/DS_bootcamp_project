*Final project to complete the data science bootcamp organized by Sages*

<br />

Full version of the project with LDA visualisation can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/klauresh/DS_bootcamp_project/blob/master/Final_project.ipynb#topic=0&lambda=1&term=).

### Highlights of the project:
* NLP analysis
* LDA topic modelling
* comparing three approaches to predictive modelling: 
    * Nominal Classification
    * Ordinal Classification
    * Regression
                                                     
* Implementing NNRank - neural net for ordinal classification
* Implementing custom keras metric to calculate ordinal accuracy
* Trying out mord package for ordinal logistic regression                                                    
* Comparing LSTM NN with XGBClassifier/ XGBRegressor and Logistic Regression/ Linear Regression
